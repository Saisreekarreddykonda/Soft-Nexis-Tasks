# 🚀 SQL Internship Projects – Soft Nexis Technology

Welcome to my **SQL internship project portfolio**, completed during my internship at **Soft Nexis Technology**. This repository contains four hands-on tasks that cover real-world database operations — from basic data retrieval to complex joins, reporting, and data integrity practices.

🛠️ All tasks were written using **MySQL syntax** and tested on [**DB Fiddle**](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) for a seamless, installation-free development environment.

## ✅ Task 1: Basic Data Retrieval & Filtering

🎯 **Objective**: Learn the foundational SQL syntax for querying single tables.

### ✨ Skills Practiced:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIKE`, `LIMIT`, `BETWEEN`
- Filtering rows based on salary, department, and date
- Pattern matching and sorting by multiple fields

📄 **Live Query**: [DB Fiddle Link – Task 1](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/5Hc94K7r6gUfwcnHRFrMMF/0)

## 📊 Task 2: Aggregation & Reporting

🎯 **Objective**: Generate summary reports using grouped data, aggregates, and window functions.

### ✨ Skills Practiced:
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`
- Using `LAG()` for year-over-year change
- Bucketizing salaries and calculating department-wise distribution

## 🔗 Task 3: Multi-Table Joins & Subqueries

🎯 **Objective**: Query across multiple related tables using joins and subqueries.

### ✨ Skills Practiced:
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `UNION ALL`
- Subqueries for fetching current salary
- Gender ratio analysis using conditional aggregation
- Avoiding Cartesian products and optimizing join performance

## 🛠️ Task 4: Data Modification & Integrity

🎯 **Objective**: Perform real-world insert, update, delete operations with data validation and constraints.

### ✨ Skills Practiced:
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- Primary and foreign key enforcement
- Transaction control using `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`
- Consistency checks before and after modifications

## 🧪 How to Run

> These queries were executed and tested on DB Fiddle using MySQL 8.0.

To test the queries yourself:

1. Open the provided DB Fiddle links.
2. Review the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` sections to understand the schema.
3. Modify the queries or run your own against the sample data.

You can also replicate this locally if you have MySQL installed.
